Let's start the journey of config files!

**Disclaimer**:

These configuration files aren't flexible and they are oriented to my personal PC and current way of thinking. So, right now, they aren't user-friendly-customized and probably non operational if someone is going to clone and use these files (for example, don't run the install.sh, it is still work in progress)

Although, as the time comes, in the next versions, I would be glad to make those files more flexible and better documented so anyone could benefit of them (if this is possible!)

For now, you can use them as "food for thought"... Sometimes, an impulse is more important than everything else!

**Love & Peace**
